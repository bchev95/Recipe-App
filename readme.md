# Recipe Suggestion App

#### Overview:
This is a MERN stack application for generating recipe suggestions based on user preferences and input. Users can search for new recipes and 'favorite' them to easily find them again.

#### To install dependencies:
1. Navigate to '/server' and run "npm install"
2. Navigate to '/client' and run "npm install"

#### To run:
1. Ensure all dependencies were successfully installed (you should see a 'node_modules' folder in both /client and /server)
2. Navigate to '/server' and run "npm run dev" - this will run both server and client at once

Alternatively, if you want to run only one, you can run just the server or just the client by entering "npm run start" in either directory (/server or /client)

#### Future plans:
1. Add a user rating system for recipes
2. Continue to upgrade the suggestion algorithm, integrating users ratings for other dishes
3. Implement a calendar meal planning system
